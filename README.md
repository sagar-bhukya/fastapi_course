1.Introduction to FastAPI:->
Explain what FastAPI is and its key features. Provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a FastAPI project, including installation, creating a basic app, and running it locally.
2.Setting Up Your Environment:->
  Describe the process of setting up a development environment for FastAPI. Include instructions on installing Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, and other essential packages. Explain how to create and activate a virtual environment.
3.Basic Routing and HTTP Methods:->
  Provide examples of how to create routes in FastAPI. Explain how to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with corresponding route handlers. Include examples of returning JSON responses.
4.Path and Query Parameters:->
  Describe how to use path parameters and query parameters in FastAPI routes. Provide examples that demonstrate extracting these parameters from incoming requests and using them within route handlers.
5.Request and Response Models:->
  Explain how to create Pydantic models for request validation in FastAPI. Provide examples of defining models, using them in route handlers, and validating incoming JSON data. Demonstrate how to use models for structuring response data.
6.Dependency Injection
  Describe the concept of dependency injection and how it is implemented in FastAPI. Provide examples of creating and using dependencies, including for database connections, authentication, and other reusable components.
7.Database Integration:->
  Explain how to integrate a database (such as SQLite or PostgreSQL) with FastAPI. Provide step-by-step instructions on setting up SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM, creating database models, and performing CRUD operations.
8.Authentication and Authorization:->
  Describe the process of adding authentication and authorization to a FastAPI application. Include examples of using OAuth2, JWT tokens, and password hashing. Explain how to secure routes and handle user roles.
9.Background Tasks:=>
  Explain how to create and run background tasks in FastAPI. Provide examples of using the `BackgroundTasks` class to perform tasks such as sending emails or processing data asynchronously.
10.Middleware:->
  Describe the role of middleware in FastAPI and how to create and apply middleware. Provide examples of middleware for logging requests, handling CORS, and processing requests before they reach route handlers.
11.Testing FastAPI Applications:->
  Explain how to write tests for FastAPI applications. Include examples of testing routes, dependencies, and database interactions using pytest and HTTPX. Describe how to set up test configurations and fixtures.
12.Advanced Features:->
  Provide an overview of advanced FastAPI features. Include examples of setting up WebSocket connections, integrating GraphQL using Strawberry or Graphene, and using async/await for asynchronous programming.
13.Deployment:->
Describe the process of deploying a FastAPI application. Include instructions for deploying to popular platforms such as Heroku, AWS, and Docker. Explain best practices for configuration, scaling, and security.
